 *
 * These live in the 3D scene rather than in the overlay on purpose: drawn as
 * sprites they sit in the depth buffer, so a building in front simply hides
 * the marker behind it. An HTML overlay would have to be told about occlusion,
 * and would get it wrong every time the camera moved. (The dotted line back to
 * the card is the opposite case — flat, always on top, and so belongs in DOM.)
 *
 * Their *size*, though, is screen-space: each bolt is a fixed number of CSS
 * pixels tall, and the world scale that produces it is recomputed each frame
 * from the sprite's own depth. The marker is one end of a flat annotation whose
 * other end (the trail) is drawn in DOM at a fixed stroke width and fixed
 * pixel-sized kinks — measuring the two in different units is what made the gap
 * between them impossible to keep still.
