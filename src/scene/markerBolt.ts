/**
 * The lightning bolt an area marker is drawn as: its outline, how far its ink

 *
 * Pure — no three.js, no canvas, no DOM — because all three of its consumers
 * live in different worlds and none of them is testable. `SectionMarkers` paints
 * the outline into a canvas texture and sizes it in WebGL; `CardLeaderLine`
 * (DOM/SVG) has to stop its trail short of the same ink; `SectionCard` only wants
 * the colour. Keeping the shape here is what stops the trail's idea of the
 * marker's edge from drifting away from the marker's own.

/**
 * The bolt's outline, in a unit space where x runs right, **y runs down**, and

 * y-down deliberately: canvas 2D and screen pixels both count y downwards, so
 * the same numbers paint the texture and answer the trail's questions without a
 * sign flip in between — and a sign flip nobody can see is exactly the kind of
 * bug that would put the trail's gap on the wrong end of the bolt.
 *
 * Reaching ±1 vertically is not decoration. `markerScaleForScreenRadius()` is
 * asked for a scale that draws the glyph `halfHeight` px from its centre, and
 * it can only deliver that if the painted shape actually reaches the extent the
 * sizing maths assumes. Editing these points without keeping the top and bottom
 * tips at ∓1 silently shrinks every marker.
 *
 * A simple (non-self-intersecting) hexagon: the two long edges are parallel, so
 * the upper wedge and the lower one never cross.

 *
 * `toward` points **from the marker outwards towards whatever is asking** — the
 * trail passes the direction back towards the card, i.e. the negation of its
 * own travel direction.
 *
 * A single radius was enough while the marker was a disc, whose edge is the
 * same distance away whichever way you look. The bolt's is not: straight up the
 * ink stops at 0.61 of the half-height (the tips lean off-axis), straight
 * across at 0.45. Subtracting the half-height outright — the shape of the old
 * code — would leave the trail stopping up to eight pixels short, and by a
 * different amount at every angle, which is precisely the gap-that-breathes
 * that devlog 202607 spent a release closing.
 *
 * So: the exact outline. Shoot a ray from the centre and take where it crosses
 * an edge. There is always exactly one such crossing — the outline is
 * star-shaped about its own centre, which `BOLT_PATH`'s tests pin, and which is
 * what makes "how far does the ink reach this way" a single number rather than
 * a choice between several. Written as a max anyway: it costs nothing, and it
 * stays right if the shape ever grows a notch deep enough to hide part of
 * itself from the centre.
 *
 * Two cheaper approximations were tried and dropped. An inscribed ellipse
 * (semi-axes 0.52 × 1) is not even safe — the top tip at (0.30, -1.00) sits
 * *outside* it, (0.30/0.52)² + 1 = 1.33, so it would have drawn the trail over
 * the bolt near the tips. The convex hull's support function is safe but loose:
 * 1.67× the real reach straight down, i.e. the same breathing gap in a new
 * disguise.
