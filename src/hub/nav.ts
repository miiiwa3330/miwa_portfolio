 *   the diorama with the sheet shut and the URL still saying #experience.
 * - next/link prefetches its target as soon as it is on screen. The logo is
 *   on screen on every reading page, and prefetching `/` pulled the hub's
 *   three.js bundle — three chunks, 1.27 MB — for readers who may never go
