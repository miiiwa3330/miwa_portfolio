 *
 * Derived from the reference lineup by what it leaves *visible*, not by its
 * gap, because the reference's card is a wider share of its screen than this
 * one (85% against 78%) and copying the gap across would not copy the look.
 * There, a neighbour shows 35.5 against a screen of 780 — 4.6%, so 18px at
 * 390px — which is inside the card's own 16px padding, and that is why only
 * blank card edge shows and never a letter. Working back: the card is 304px
 * at 390px, so the gap is 43 − 18 = 25px, and 25/304 puts the neighbour at
 * 1.082 of a card's width.

 * need three cards' worth of rail and there are only 390px. True, and beside
 * the point: the overlap was buying a *readable* sliver nobody had asked
 * for, at the cost of the middle card's edges being under another card's
