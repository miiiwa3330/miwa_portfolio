/**
 * The shape of the lightning that runs from the card out to its area's marker.
 *
 * Pure, and in a coordinate system of its own: `along` is the distance from the
 * near end towards the far one, `lift` the sideways offset from that axis.
 * `CardLeaderLine` owns the mapping to screen pixels — which keeps everything
 * here testable without a DOM, and keeps the shape from quietly depending on
 * which way the trail happens to point.
 *
 * It replaced a regular zigzag (`^^^^`, a fixed 11px step and 6px amplitude).
 * The waveform is all that was thrown away; three structural properties the old
 * code fought for are still here, because a lightning bolt needs them for the
 * same reasons a zigzag did:
 *
 *  1. Both ends land exactly where the caller says, so the clearances it
 *     measured from the card's dot and the marker's ink still hold.
 *  2. Vertices are positioned counting up from the near end, so the kinks near
 *     the card do not shuffle about as the trail lengthens and shortens.
 *  3. A vertex that comes into existence does so **without a jump**. This is the
 *     one that random jaggedness makes hardest: a new kink arriving with its
 *     full sideways offset would flick the far end of the trail every time the
 *     scene turned by a pixel. See `envelope` below — it is answered by the
 *     shape of the formula rather than by a special case.

 * combination pulls towards the middle, so the bolt's typical offset settled
