 * behind it — the stack is what says so, and what makes stepping through them
 * an obvious thing to try. The two layers behind carry no text: only a
 * fingernail's width of each is ever visible, and giving them real content
 * would tie their height to copy nobody can read.
 *
 * Which area it shows is not decided here. It reads `section` and asks for a
 * step; the camera turns, and the area it ends up facing comes back down as a
 * new `section`. Card and camera never write to each other — see
 * `facingStop` in `scene/room/layout.ts` for why that direction matters.
