/**
 * The brief play/pause badge a tap on empty sky leaves behind.
 *
 * On a phone the pause button is gone and tapping the diorama is what freezes
 * it (see `useTapGesture` in Scene.tsx). A gesture with no button has no
 * resting state to read, so the only thing that can say what just happened is
 * the moment itself — hence a badge that states the new state and leaves,
 * the way a video player's does. It is deliberately *not* a persistent
 * indicator: a permanent "paused" chip over the room would be one more
 * thing occupying a screen this whole redesign is trying to clear.
 *
 * Shown only for the tap. The desktop header still has a real pause button
 * whose own fill says whether the town is frozen, so flashing this there
 * would be announcing something already on screen.
 */

/**
 * How long the badge stays, in seconds.
 *
 * Long enough to be read as a state ("it is paused now") rather than seen as
 * a flicker, short enough that a second tap during the first badge's exit is
 * not a common case. Matched to the ~0.6s video players settle on.
