 * cell count is a composition choice and moves; what these tests hold is the
 * thing that has to be true at any count. That only
 * holds while every character in the Japanese copy is one em wide, which
 * half-width Latin and digits are not: a stray `2026` is 4 characters that
 * occupy about 2 cells, so the line it lands on stops lining up with its
 * neighbours — and nothing else fails. The page still renders, the text is
 * still readable, and the only symptom is that the grid quietly stops being
 * a grid.
 *
 * So the copy is written in full-width forms (`２０２６`), and this is the
 * guard on that. It is deliberately a text scan rather than an import:
 * aboutCopy.tsx is JSX, and the suite is a node environment with
 * no DOM by design (see vitest.config.ts).
