/**
 * The About column: text straight over the diorama, with no card and no sheet,
 * scrolled like the Star Wars opening crawl — tilted back in 3D so each line
 * enters upright from the bottom of the screen and recedes away from the
 * reader as it climbs, rather than sliding up the screen flat.
 *
 * The only area you leave by finishing it. Every other section is a full-screen
 * panel bracketed by transparent spacers, and scrolling off either one returns;
 * here the column itself is the scroller, and reaching the bottom of the
 * writing is what goes home. That replaced a HOME button — a control that had
 * to be noticed and aimed at, sitting over a page whose whole premise is that
 * you get around by moving through it.
 *
 * The tilt (`rotateX`, anchored at the bottom edge of the viewport so the
 * pivot stays put while the content scrolls past it) does the work a real
 * crawl gets from its camera: text is full size and flat-on right where it
 * enters at the bottom, and shrinks toward the vanishing point as it climbs.
 * The bottom has no mask at all — a line does not fade in, it is simply
 * there the moment it scrolls into the box. The top carries a short one (the
 * last 12% of the column), but only as a finishing touch on top of the
 * shrink, not as the thing doing the disappearing: a perspective distance
 * steep enough to shrink a line to nothing on its own, unmasked, also
 * distorted the wide, near lines it shares a transform with, so the shrink
 * is tuned gentle enough to stay undistorted and the mask only ever catches
 * content it has already taken most of the way down. Nothing is visible for
 * a beat at the very start: a short leading spacer sits before the heading,
 * so the box opens empty and the first line only climbs into it once the
 * column has advanced past that spacer — sized against the auto-play speed
 * below, not against the viewport, since the spacer is a pause to hold on
 * and not a distance to hide. It advances on its own — a real crawl runs
 * without a hand on the wheel, and this one plays the same way; scrolling
 * only speeds it up or backs it up, it is never required to make it move at
 * all. The perspective container has to be a separate element from the
 * scrolling one:
 * framer-motion owns the `transform` property on whichever element carries
 * its `x`/`opacity` entrance animation, and would overwrite a CSS `rotateX`
 * set on that same element every frame it animates.
 *
 * The copy below is placeholder standing in for the real thing: it is drawn
 * from the dates and projects in Experience so that it reads truthfully and is
 * long enough for the scrolling to have something to do, but it is written to
 * be replaced.

            the frame, not a paragraph sized for reading comfort.

            Centered, not left-aligned — this is what left-aligned text was
            doing to the "stretched, unreadable" complaint: `rotateX` and
            `perspective-origin` are both centered on the column's own
            width, so they shrink every line's X offset toward that center
            line. Left-aligned text sits far to the left of it, so each
            line's start crept rightward toward center by a different amount
            depending on its own depth, and consecutive lines drifted out of
            alignment with each other — reading as warped rather than just
            smaller. Centered text has no such offset: a line's own middle
            already sits on the axis everything shrinks toward, so it only
            gets smaller, never skewed.

            The body below is justified rather than centered now, which is
            not a counter-example: every justified line is exactly as wide as
            the block, so each line's middle lands on that same axis. What
            the warning rules out is a line whose *middle* is off-axis, and
            neither centering nor justification produces one. */}

        {/*
         * Set on a grid of a whole number of full-width characters per line,
         * which is the shape `reference/image9.jpg` is built on. Four things
         * in that frame decide the whole of this block:
         *
         *   1. every line holds the same number of characters — 13 in the
         *      reference ("反乱軍の苦闘は続いていた。", "恐るべき帝国宇宙艦隊の追撃",
         *      "から逃れ、ルーク・スカイウ"), 15 here by request;
         *   2. both edges are flush, only a paragraph's last line runs short;
         *   3. there is no kinsoku — "ォーカーに率いられた自由の" starts a line
         *      with a small kana, which is exactly what lets (1) hold;
         *   4. a paragraph's first line is indented one character.
         *
         * `w-[15em]` with the font size on the same element is what makes (1)
         * literal: outside `font-size` itself, `em` resolves against the
         * element's own computed size, so 15em *is* 15 full-width cells at
         * any size. That replaces the four breakpoint steps this used to
         * carry (`text-3xl sm:text-4xl lg:text-6xl xl:text-7xl`) — those were
         * an approximation of the same "hold characters-per-line" goal, and a
         * loose one: they measured out to 9.7 / 14.6 / 13.8 / 15.0 characters
         * across the breakpoints. With the measure fixed, size is free to be
         * one continuous figure.
         *
         * `4.8vw` is a ceiling, not a taste, and it is the half of this pair
         * that has to move whenever the cell count does: the scroller is the
         * shell's `w-[75%]`, so the font can be at most 75/15 = 5vw before
         * the block outgrows it, and 15 × 4.8vw = 72vw leaves 4% of headroom
         * under that. A block wider than the scroller would be clipped in the
         * scroller's own local space, before the perspective — the
         * `overflow-y: auto` forces `overflow-x: auto` trap the outer shell's
         * comment describes, which eats the far lines as hard as the near
         * ones. `4.5rem` caps it at what `xl:text-7xl` used to be, the size
         * already fitted to clear the planet (image9 has nothing but stars in
         * it to share the frame with). The cap only bites past a ~1500px
         * viewport, where 15em is 1080px against a 1125px scroller.
         *
         * `line-break: anywhere` is (3): without it a line that has to push a
         * 、 to the next row comes up one cell short, and justification opens
         * that missing cell up as visible letter-spacing across the whole
         * line. `indent-[1em]` is (4), and stays on the grid because one em
         * is exactly one cell — an indented first line is 12 cells, still a
         * whole number.
         *
         * `text-spacing-trim` / `text-autospace` are pinned rather than left
         * to the UA. Both insert or remove sub-em space around punctuation
         * and between kana and Latin, both have defaults that are still
         * moving, and either one firing would break the grid silently — the
         * text would still look fine, just no longer aligned.
         *
         * The grid also assumes the copy holds no half-width characters; the
         * Japanese paragraphs above are written with full-width Latin and
         * digits for that reason, and `aboutCopy.test.ts` is what keeps them
         * that way.
