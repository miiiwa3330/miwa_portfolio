 * Metadata for a reading page (a product's write-up, a note, or an index).
 *
 * **The canonical URL has to be set on every one of them.** The root layout
 * declares `alternates.canonical: "https://miiiwa.com"` for the hub, and a
 * child that sets nothing inherits it — every write-up would then tell search
 * engines "I am a copy of the top page" and be dropped from the index, with
 * nothing on screen to show it. `pageMeta.test.ts` holds this.
 *
 * `openGraph` is rebuilt whole rather than extended: Next merges metadata
 * one key deep, so a child's `openGraph` replaces the layout's entirely —
 * including `siteName` and `locale`, which would otherwise vanish.
